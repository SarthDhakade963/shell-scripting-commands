cp -r folder1 folder2

## Read from File Line by Line
while read line; do
	echo "Line: $line"
done < myfile.txt

## Append and Overwrite

echo "Second Line" >> myfile.txt

## Check if file exists
if [[ -f "notes.txt" ]; then
	echo "‚úÖ File exists!"
else
	echo "‚ùå File does not exist."
fi


## Loop Over Directory in Files
file="hello.txt"
for file in *.txt
do
	echo "Found file: $file"
done

## Read file Line by Line
while IFS= read -r line
do
	echo "Processing: $line"

## Until Loop runs until the conditions become true

count=1
until [ $count -gt 5]
do
	echo "count is : $count"
	((count++))
done


## Loop control

for i in {1..10}
do
	if [ $i -eq 3 ]; then

## A HereDoc (short for Here Document) lets you redirect multiple lines of input into a command as if you typed
## them line-by-line.

cat <<EOF > hello.txt
Hello, Sarthak!
Welcome to Shell Scripting
This is a multi-file line
EOF

## Append instead of Overwrite
cat <<EOF >> hello.txt
[$(date)] This log was appended
EOF

## Use variable
name="Sarthak"
cat <<EOF
Hello $name!
Today is $(date)
EOF


## Basic Error Handling
cp file.txt /nonexistent/path
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
	echo "‚ùå Copy failed!"
else
	echo "‚úÖ Copy succeeded!"
fi

## Use set -e to Exit on First Error

set -e #Exit on error
echo "Creating backup..."
cp file.txt /backup/

echo "Uploading to S3..."
aws s3 cp /backup/file.txt s3://my-bucket/

## Trap Error and Cleanup
set -e
trap cleanup EXIT

cleanup() {
	echo "üßπ Cleaning up temporary files..."
	rm -rf /tmp/myapp
}

mkdir /tmp/myapp
cp data.csv /tmp/myapp


## Best Practise for Production Grade Scripts
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail
# e = exit on error
# u = undefined vars are errors
# o pipefail = if any command in a pipeline fails, whole pipeline fails

trap 'echo "‚ùå ERROR on line $LINENO"; exit 1' ERR

do_backup() {
  cp "$1" "$2"
  echo "‚úÖ Backup complete"
}

do_backup file.txt /nonexistent/backup/
